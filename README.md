Customer Complaints Analysis Using Text Mining

The dataset compiles consumer complaints received by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection about financial products and services for the years 2021-2016. 

This project aims to predict whether the resolution will be disputed by the consumer from the variables available; as some variables are text, text mining techniques will be applied to derive input values for modeling.
